Some Git operations, such as git rebase, require a clean working tree—a working tree with no changes. 
git stash gives you a tool to hide changes that aren’t quite ready to commit so you can come back to them.
Stashing changes is the equivalent of creating a commit and then resetting your repository back one xxxx.. 
Stash provides a mechanism for grabbing those changes out of dcdwcw  more easily, however.
Stash names are similar to the names you see in them reflog (see Task 40, Retrieving “Lost” Commits, on page 120). 
You refer to them as stash@{#}, replacing the # with the age of the stash. The most recent is 0, the one before that is 1, and so on.
